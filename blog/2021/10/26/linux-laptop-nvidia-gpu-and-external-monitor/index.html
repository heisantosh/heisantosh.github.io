<h2>Linux, Laptop Nvidia GPU and External Monitor</h2>
</div>
<article class=post-content>
<p>I have a laptop, an Acer Predator model. When I bought it, Windows 10 Home was installed by default. Linux has been a mainstay in the systems I have owned. In the beginning I kept a dualboot setup of - Windows 10 and Archcraft. It was a much easier Arch distro to start with. I enjoyed it for a while. I used it for work and playing games. This laptop has an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU. I was able to run games like No Man&rsquo;s Sky and Biomutant.</p>
<p>I have an external monitor. One of my gripes with this setup was the desktop was visible on the external monitor only when I&rsquo;m logged in. Before that I had to open the laptop, do the login, close it and see the desktop show up on the external monitor. I wanted to see the login screen on the external monitor.</p>
<p>Adding to this I see that the polybar scripts that I used was using more CPU than I expected. There were too many updates everyday. And after a certain period the updates keep breaking the rofi themes that I was using. Some of the network modules was not showing the Wifi connection states correctly many times. So, I started looking for a more mainstream Arch distro - with a bigger community and wiki. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend more of my time fixing these issues.</p>
<p>So, I switched to Manjaro GNOME edition. The default setup works fine with the external monitor. But I noticed that on the external monitor it appears a bit janky with the animations. To fix it I planned to use the GPU all the time. After some check on the Arch and Manjaro wiki I found that the option would be install missing Nvidia drivers and use the optimus-manager tool.</p>
<p>One of the things I found out was the HDMI port was directly connected to the GPU. It means to connect to an external monitor the GPU needs to be enabled. The optimus-manager is a tool that allows one to choose the GPU modes - integrated, nvidia and hybrid. If we use the integrated mode (use Intel&rsquo;s integrated GPU) then using the external monitor is not possible. Using the hybrid mode works but there is a significant latency in the GUI, 2/3 seconds of lag. So the only option is to use the nvidia mode.</p>
<p>If we switch the mode, it requires a login and logout of the session to take effect. But the mode switch is not permanent. It resets on reboot. As per the documentation of the <a href=https://github.com/Askannz/optimus-manager>optimus-manager</a> project, we can specify a kernel param to persist the config- <code>optimus-manager.startup=nvidia</code>. And we also need to disable Wayland in the GDM(GNOME Display Manager) configuration.</p>
<p>So, here are the steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install propietary Nvidia drivers, on Manjaro this can be done using the &ldquo;Toolbox&rdquo;</li>
<li>Disable Wayland in GDM config. Set <code>WaylandEnable</code> to <code>false</code>.</li>
</ol>

<li>Add the kernel parameter <code>optimus-manager.startup=nvidia</code>. Edit the file <code>/etc/default/grub</code> and append the parameter to the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFALULT</code>. Then generate the GRUB config.</li>

‚ùØ sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
</code></pre></div><ol start=4>
<li>Reboot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, on the external monitor the GUI is much smoother and I do not see the jankiness anymore.</p>
